This landmark case revolves around the concept of \"terminal leave\" and its implications for government employees.\n\n**Case Background**\n\nThe case involves a retired Assistant Accountant General, Ramana Dayaram Shetty, who claimed that he was entitled to terminal leave as per the Government Servants (General Rules), 1920 (GS(GR) Rule). The International Airport Authority of India (IAAI) contested this claim, stating that Shetty's employment with the IAAI was governed by the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972.\n\n**Let's Begin!**\n\nOn what basis do you think Ramana Dayaram Shetty should be entitled to terminal leave? Should it be based on his original employment rules or the new rules applicable to the IAAI?\n\n(Proceeding directly to the next part of the case...)\n\nThe court will now consider the arguments presented by both parties.\n\n**Next Part:**\n\nIn this section, we'll examine the key points raised by Shetty's counsel. Shetty argued that he was entitled to terminal leave as per the GS(GR) Rule, which provided for a lump sum payment in lieu of earned leave and half pay leave upon retirement. The IAAI, however, countered that the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, applied to all government employees, including those employed by autonomous bodies like the IAAI.\n\nShetty's counsel pointed out that the GS(GR) Rule was applicable to Shetty at the time of his transfer from the General Finance Department to the IAAI in 1957. They argued that the new rules could not be retrospectively applied to Shetty, as this would amount to an unjust enrichment for him.\n\nDo you think it's fair to retrospectively apply new rules to an employee who had been governed by a different set of regulations at the time of their transfer?\n\n(Please note: The user is encouraged to consider this question thoughtfully, and I'll proceed directly to the next part of the case.)"
