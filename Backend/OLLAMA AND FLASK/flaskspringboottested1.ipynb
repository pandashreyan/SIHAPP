Let's dive into the proceedings of **Ramana Dayaram Shetty vs The International Airport Authority of India** decided on May 4, 1979.\n\n**Case Background**\nThe plaintiff, Ramana Dayaram Shetty, was a passenger who had been forcibly removed from a domestic flight by airport security personnel at Mumbai Airport. Shetty alleged that he was subjected to physical violence and harassment during his removal.\n\n**Step 1: Petition Filed**\nShetty filed a petition under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution, seeking a writ of mandamus to be issued against the International Airport Authority of India (IAAI) and its officials for their actions. He claimed that his fundamental rights were violated, including Articles 14 (equality before law), 19(1)(f) (right to freedom of trade or business), and 21 (protection of life and liberty).\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n**Question:** Do you think the IAAI officials overstepped their authority by removing Shetty from the flight?\n\nPlease note that we'll proceed with the case without waiting for your response.\n\n**Step 2: Court Proceedings**\nThe Bombay High Court (now known as the Maharashtra and Goa Common High Court) accepted the petition and issued a notice to the IAAI. The court, comprising Justice V.D. Bhutani and Justice A.N. Grover, heard arguments from both sides.\n\nDuring the proceedings, it was revealed that Shetty had been removed from the flight allegedly for creating a disturbance and refusing to pay excess baggage charges. However, Shetty denied these allegations and claimed he was innocent.\n\n**Question:** Who do you think is telling the truth in this situation?"
