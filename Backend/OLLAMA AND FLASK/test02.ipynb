This landmark case was decided by the Supreme Court of India on May 4, 1979.\n\n**Step 1: Background**\nIn 1978, Ramana Dayaram Shetty, a retired employee, along with his family members, attempted to board a flight from Bombay (now Mumbai) to London at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. However, their boarding passes were cancelled due to an error in the computer system of the airport authority.\n\n**Question 1: Agree/Disagree type**\nDo you think it's fair that Ramana Dayaram Shetty and his family members were not allowed to board the flight despite having valid tickets?\n\nLet's proceed with the next part of the case...\n\n**Step 2: Proceedings in the Airport**\nThe airport authority cited a lack of sufficient space for passengers on the flight as the reason for cancelling their boarding passes. However, Ramana Dayaram Shetty disputed this claim, stating that there was adequate space available.\n\n**Question 2: Analytical opinion type**\nWho do you think is at fault here - the airport authority or Ramana Dayaram Shetty? Should the authorities have been more transparent about the reasons for cancelling their passes?\n\nMoving on to the next part of the case...\n\n**Step 3: Lawsuit and Court Proceedings**\nRamana Dayaram Shetty filed a lawsuit against the International Airport Authority of India, claiming compensation for the inconvenience caused. The court had to interpret the relevant laws, including the Airports (Inspection) Act, 1958, and the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1937.\n\n**Question 3: Predictive question**\nWhat do you think the court's decision will be in this case? Will Ramana Dayaram Shetty succeed in his claim for compensation?\n\nLet's see what happens next...\n\n**Step 4: Verdict and Conclusion**\nThe Supreme Court of India delivered its verdict on May 4, 1979. The bench held that the airport authority was liable for the inconvenience caused to Ramana Dayaram Shetty and his family members.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   The court emphasized the importance of transparency in decision-making by authorities.\n*   It also highlighted the need for compensation for passengers affected by errors or oversights on the part of the authorities.\n\n**Actual Verdict:** The Supreme Court awarded a substantial amount as compensation to Ramana Dayaram Shetty and his family members, while also directing the airport authority to take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future."
