🌟 Welcome to Your React Native Project!
This is a brand-new React Native app, bootstrapped using the powerful React Native Community CLI. Whether you're just starting out or enhancing an existing app, this guide will help you set up and modify your app with ease.

Getting Started
Before you begin building with React Native, make sure your development environment is ready to go. Follow the steps outlined in the React Native - Environment Setup documentation until you reach the "Creating a new application" section. This ensures that your system is properly configured to run React Native projects.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server 🚀
Metro is the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native. It helps package and bundle the JavaScript code for your app. To get started, launch the Metro server by running the following command from the root directory of your React Native project:

bash
Copy code
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Let Metro run in its own terminal window while you continue working on other tasks in a separate terminal.

Step 2: Launch Your Application 📱
Once Metro is running, it’s time to launch your app on either Android or iOS. Open a new terminal and use one of the following commands:

For Android 📱:
bash
Copy code
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS 📱:
bash
Copy code
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
Your app should now open in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, depending on your platform. If you're having trouble, make sure your emulator/simulator is properly configured.

Step 3: Modify Your App 🛠️
Now that your app is running, let’s make some changes and see them live:

Open App.tsx (or any file you want to modify) in your favorite code editor.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or open the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to reload the app and see your changes instantly.

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to reload the app on the iOS Simulator.

🎉 Congratulations! You're Ready to Build!
You’ve successfully run your React Native app and are now free to modify it as you wish. Let your creativity flow and start building an app that stands out!
